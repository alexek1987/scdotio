        Unlike influencer agencies SuperClout showcases your brand on our platforms and lets the influencers come to you.
        Using social media and influencers to review, share and post about, your brand or product is one of the most effective ways to market your business, get the word out and increase sales.
        <br />
        Have you tried reaching to out to influencers to promote your brand❓
        <br />
        <br />
        Have you sent crazy amounts of freebies to loads of influencers in the hope that one of them will tweet about it❓
        <br />
        <br />
        Did you know that influencers only post about, aprox. 8-10% of the freebies they receive in the mail? The odds aren’t great so in order to stand any chance of landing an influencer you have to send out hundreds of freebies at great cost and loss to your business.
        <br />
        <br />
        Have you paid influencer agencies to connect you with influencers❓
        <br />
        <br />
        Have you seen what they charge❓
        <br />
        <br />
         <h5>The SuperClout process</h5>
          Create your own advert, set your own parameters and make the offers you want to the influencers you want.
          <br />
          <br />
          Remember, an influencer specific to your target market, industry, genre or geography with even just 10,000 followers could be just as valuable as an influencer with 500,000+ followers. If they are dedicated, active followers that listen to the influencers every word. So, don’t judge an influencer based simply on numbers.
          The influencer community is a small world and word spreads fast, one influencer can lead to ten just from a single post.
          <br />
          <br />
It’s not what you can do for an influencer, it’s what an influencer can do for you🤳
<br />

<br />
➡   Create your Term Sheet 📄. Include your offer/s💵
<br />
➡  Screen all responses💬, check out their social media📱, and niches then decide the right influencers you want to work with.
