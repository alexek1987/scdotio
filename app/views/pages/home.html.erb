          Using social media and influencers to review, share and post about, your brand or product is one of the most effective ways to market your business, get the word out and increase sales.
Have you tried reaching to out to influencers to promote your brand?
Have you sent crazy amounts of freebies to loads of influencers in the hope that one of them will tweet about it?
Did you know that influencers only post about, aprox. 8-10% of the freebies they receive in the mail? The odds aren’t great so in order to stand any chance of landing an influencer you have to send out hundreds of freebies at great cost and loss to your business.
Have you paid influencer agencies to connect you with influencers? Have you seen what they charge?
